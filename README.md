# Under- A Journey-Sharing-application

An android based mobile application was developed for travellers to find compatible fellow-travellers to share a journey in real time. The application communicates with the devices using a peer-to-peer network (implemented using Google Nearby) and has a central service as backup to prevent single point of failure. It is integrated with Mapbox SDK to navigate and compute the optimized route for the group of travellers.
